# Emoji Clock

This is a web component for an emoji clock.

### Why?

I was interested to see what it might be like to use 'native' web components, without a library
like Polymer to polyfill it.

### Should I use this?

It's been tested to work on Chrome, but nowhere else.

### Usage

Add this script to the top of your page:

```html
<script src="emoji-clock.js">
```

Then, in your HTML, instantiate a new emoji clock:

```html
<emoji-clock time=""></emoji-clock>
```
